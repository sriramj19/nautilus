# Nautilus

This is a simple(and basic) nautilus replica in Angular. Feel free to navigate through the application. No external frameworks or libraries used.

## Development server

Run `yarn start` or `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3003/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
